### Text editing architecture

PDFZero uses a layered editing model:

```text
PDF bytes
  -> PDF.js render + text extraction
  -> canonical text run metadata
  -> browser overlay editor
  -> layout-fit/export planner
  -> pdf-lib browser export
  -> future PDFium/MuPDF advanced engine
```

Current browser path:

1. **Render** - PDF.js renders each page to a high-resolution canvas.
2. **Extract** - PDF.js extracts text runs, transforms, font ids, approximate font names, color, baseline, ascent/descent, and edit boxes.
3. **Model** - PDFZero stores original run metadata: text, bbox, baseline, font fallback, color, line height, estimated glyph advances, and max edit dimensions.
4. **Overlay** - Editable DOM text is positioned over the PDF raster and uses local background sampling to hide the original text while editing.
5. **Fit** - On export, edited text is laid out line-by-line and fit back to the original run width using conservative character spacing and small size adjustment.
6. **Export** - pdf-lib writes background patches, replacement text, annotations, page operations, and document tools.

This is not yet full Acrobat/Foxit-style object editing. The current path is an overlay-and-repair browser exporter. The production-grade target is an advanced engine that can inspect and rewrite PDF page objects directly:

```text
src/pdf/
  engines/
    pdfjsEngine.ts       # Browser render/extract fallback
    pdfiumEngine.ts      # Planned object-level editor
    mupdfEngine.ts       # Optional native/WASM alternative
  model/
    TextRun.ts           # glyphs, fonts, colors, matrices, resources
    FontResource.ts
    EditOperation.ts
  layout/
    glyphMetrics.ts
    fitText.ts
    paragraphReflow.ts
  background/
    renderWithoutText.ts
    inpaintPatch.ts
  export/
    exportPlanner.ts
    pdfLibOverlayExporter.ts
    objectRewriteExporter.ts
  repair/
    visualDiff.ts
    autoFitRepair.ts
```

The browser-only implementation can be excellent for simple and moderately complex PDFs. True high-level editing for embedded subset fonts, object removal, kerning-preserving replacement, complex scripts, and image/gradient background reconstruction requires PDFium, MuPDF, or another real PDF content engine.
